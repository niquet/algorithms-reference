## Getting Started

To make the most out of the data structures in this directory, it's essential to understand their operations, use cases, and implementation details. This section provides a brief overview of key concepts related to data structures.

Data structures are tools for organizing and storing data effectively, providing efficient access, modification, and retrieval operations. They can help optimize algorithms and improve program performance. Here are some commonly used data structures:
- **Arrays**: A fixed-size collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays provide constant-time access to individual elements.
- **Linked Lists**: A collection of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node. Linked lists are dynamic and allow for efficient insertions and deletions.
- **Stacks**: A data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from one end, typically called the top of the stack.
- **Queues**: A data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at one end, called the rear, and removed from the other end, called the front.
- **Trees**: Hierarchical data structures with nodes connected by edges. Trees have a root node and can have child nodes and parent nodes.
- **Graphs**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graphs can be directed (edges have a specific direction) or undirected (edges have no specific direction).
- **Heaps**: A complete binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues.
- **Hash Tables**: An associative array that maps keys to values using a hash function. Hash tables provide efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations.

It's important to study and understand the characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of each data structure to choose the appropriate one for solving specific problems.

## Data Structure Implementations

Inside this directory, you will find implementations of various data structures. Each data structure has its own directory, named after the data structure. Inside each directory, you will find:

- `README.md`: Provides a detailed explanation of the data structure, including its operations, use cases, and implementation details.
- Source code files: Contains code implementations showcasing the data structure's functionality and usage.

Feel free to explore the different data structure implementations and learn from their explanations and code. You can also contribute to this repository by adding new data structures or improving existing implementations.
