## Introduction
In this repository, you will find a collection of algorithms and data structures that I have studied and implemented. The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in learning or reviewing these fundamental concepts. Each algorithm and data structure is accompanied by detailed explanations and code implementations.

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:niquet/algorithms-reference.git
```

2. **Repository Structure:** The repository is structured as follows:
  - `algorithms/` contains various algorithm implementations.
  - `data-structures/` contains implementations of different data structures.
  - `examples/` contains additional code examples related to algorithms and data structures related to LeetCode problems.
  - `README.md` provides an overview of the repository and instructions for usage. 

3. **Explore Algorithm Implementations:** Inside the `algorithms/` directory, each algorithm has its own directory named after the algorithm's name. Within each algorithm directory, you will find:
  - README.md: Provides a detailed explanation of the algorithm, including its time and space complexity analysis.
  - Source code files: Contains code implementations in a programming language of choice, demonstrating how the algorithm works.
  - Examples and test cases: Includes sample inputs and expected outputs to validate the correctness and efficiency of the algorithm.

4. **Study Data Structure Implementations**: Inside the `data-structures/` directory, each data structure has its own directory named after the data structure. Within each data structure directory, you will find:
  - README.md: Provides a detailed explanation of the data structure, including its operations and use cases.
  - Source code files: Contains code implementations showcasing the data structure's functionality and usage.

5. **Review Examples and LeetCode Solutions:** The `examples/` directory contains additional code examples related to algorithms, data structures, and LeetCode solutions. Each LeetCode problem solution is organized in its own directory, named after the problem's title or identification number. Inside each directory, you will find:
  - README.md: Provides the problem statement and an explanation of the approach used to solve it.
  - Source code files: Contains code implementations that solve the problem, along with test cases and complexity analysis.

## Algorithms
